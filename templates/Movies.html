alcoholic surgeon, Vikram (Rajkummar Rao) is a panic attack-stricken brilliant detective who
excels at work despite his recurring nightmares and PTSD. HIT doesn’t glorify its hero’s ordeal
though. It’s brave enough to acknowledge him as ‘unfit’ for his investigative field job despite the
talent. Rooted in pain, Vikram’s silent heroism and deductive reasoning skills keep you
invested, if not on the edge of your seat<br> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81436989"> Watch now </a>
